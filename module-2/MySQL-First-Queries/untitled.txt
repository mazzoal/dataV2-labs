Question 7

In question 5 we saw the ten most rated apps, and we saw that a lot of them are social media or famous game. WE can also see that the number of rating is droping significantly from the first one to the last one, where the 10th is only a third of the 1st one.

Question 8

we see that the best rated apps are all at 5 stars, and that for most of them their is only a small number of people who rate them. There is one exeption to this, the Bible app which is in the top ten and still rated at 5.

Question 9

As mention before their is one app that is present in the two list, which is rather small. We can expect that the most downloaded apps will have a lower rating than the other one!

Question 10

In order to answer this question, we have to define the importance of each component, this can be done by weighting each variable based on its importance to us and then do a weighted average of the result.

Question 11

We can see that the best-rated apps are relatively expensive and that almost none of them are free.  When we compare that to the apps with the bigger number of rating we see that all of them are free apps.  We can then say that the price of an app has an impact on the quality of an app or at least on how people perceive the app. But when testing this theory we see that the most expensive apps have a rating similar to the average. we can then conclude that the price of an app has no impact on the quality.
